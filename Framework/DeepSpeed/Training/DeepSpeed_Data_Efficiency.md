* data scale is actually increasing at a similar speed as model scale, and the training cost is proportional to both of them. 
*  Data sampling techniques aim to improve the convergence speed by sampling the most suitable next data batch from the whole data pool; 
*  Data routing techniques aim to reduce the computation by routing each data to only a subset of the model components.
