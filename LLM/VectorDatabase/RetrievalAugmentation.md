* **The Backbone: OpenAI and GPT Models**
  * **One significant limitation is that they generate responses based on patterns learned during training, without the ability to actively retrieve specific information. That’s where retrieval augmentation comes into the picture.**
* **Understanding Retrieval Augmentation**
  * **It involves combining generative pre-trained models with information retrieval systems.**
  * **The goal is to allow the model to actively retrieve and utilize specific pieces of information during inference.**
* **The Power of LangChain**
